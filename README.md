### Overview
A small react app that allows you to add items to a list and then seach for a particular one

## What I learned 
- Have to use spread operator when appending to an array for state
- useRef used to hold text in field
- A better way to find matching results of our state, is to hold what we're searhcing for in a string and 
compare it to items array, we also map that variable as it'll print our original items array without removing/affecting its state
